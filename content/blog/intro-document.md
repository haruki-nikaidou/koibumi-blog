## üé® Flexibility & Customization

### Layout Options

Choose from three content width options in your pages:

- `sm`: 50rem max-width (800px) - perfect for text-heavy content
- `md`: 70rem max-width (1120px) - default, great for most blogs
- `lg`: 90rem max-width (1440px) - ideal for galleries or wide content

### Styling

The template uses a modular SCSS architecture:

- `colors.scss`: Define your color scheme
- `global.scss`: Global styles and typography
- `components.scss`: Component-specific styles
- `article.scss`: Article content styling
- `button.scss`: Button styles

Customize colors by modifying CSS custom properties in the color files. The design uses a primary color system that automatically adapts to both light and dark modes.

### Components

All components are in `src/components/`:
- `Header.astro`: Navigation header
- `Footer.astro`: Site footer
- `Card.astro`: Card wrapper component
- `PostCard.astro`: Post preview card
- `ThemeToggle.svelte`: Dark mode toggle
- `BaseHead.astro`: SEO meta tags

Feel free to modify these or create new ones to suit your needs.

### Extending Functionality

The template is built with extensibility in mind:

- Add new Astro integrations in `astro.config.mjs`
- Add rehype/remark plugins for markdown processing
- Create new collections in `src/content/config.ts`
- Add custom routes in `src/pages/`

## üé≠ Art Considerations

### Background Images

The template uses full-page background images (`public/bg.avif` and `public/bg-dark.avif`). When creating your own:

- **Use colorful images** to add personality and visual interest
- **Keep color value range limited** - avoid extreme contrasts within the image
- **Ensure readability** - the semi-transparent cards should remain legible over the background
- **Consider both modes** - create versions optimized for both light and dark themes
- **Use modern formats** - AVIF or WebP for optimal performance

The default gradient overlays (`linear-gradient(to right, #ffcdb9, #FFC0CB)` for light mode) help soften the background and maintain readability. Adjust these in `src/styles/global.scss` to match your background images.

### Color Harmony

The design uses a primary color system. Choose colors that:
- Complement your background images
- Have sufficient contrast for accessibility
- Work well in both light and dark modes
- Reflect your personal or brand style

### Typography

The comic-style fonts create a casual, friendly atmosphere. If you prefer a different tone:
- Replace fonts in `package.json` dependencies
- Update font families in `src/styles/global.scss`
- Consider both English and other language support
